Been thinking of switching to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for a long time. With Jekyll, you transform plain text ([Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in my case) into static websites and blogs. You can either decide to publish such a site on your own server, but most of the hipsters around use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host their personal sites. So do I now. It's definitely something for hackers but the benefits are great once you made yourself comfortable with it. There are countless tutorials and experience reports for Jekyll/GH-Pages out there, no need for me to redo the same thing over and over again. However, if you're a geek like me, you should consider giving it a go.

Jekyll is extensible with plugins. It's also pretty easy to achieve syntax highlighting with Jekyll. Here is `Hello World` in Ruby.

{% highlight ruby %}
puts 'Hello world'
{% endhighlight %}

Not bad, eh? It's not as awesome as Sushi and retro consoles, but well... nearly.
