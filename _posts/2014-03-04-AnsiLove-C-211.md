I just pushed an new AnsiLove/C version `2.1.1` to the [official repository](http://github.com/ByteProject/AnsiLove-C) on GitHub. You may wonder what's new.

##Changelog

* fixed a bug that sometimes caused the Tundra parser interpreting the canvas to the end of the universe
* fixed a bug that that occassionally caused the Tundra parser to get out of range when parsing .tnd files with SAUCE
* invalid Tundra files no longer result in crashes, memory errors and dead puppies.
* resolved an issue that applied bold font style to Amiga ANSi when neither CED nor WORKBENCH mode was specified
* support for AppCode project files in .gitignore
* upgraded libgd binary for OS X to 2.1
* added libpng 1.5.18 binary for OS X
* upgraded jpeglib binary for OS X to 8.4
* resulting AnsiLove-C binary now only depending on libgd, libpng, ligjpeg

##About the update

Some of those changes where planned for quite some time now, while some can be regarded as last minute additions. [Blockalypse](http://blocktronics.org/artpacks/blockalypse/), the latest artpack from the legendary ANSi group [Blocktronics](http://blocktronics.org) has been released a few days ago. I love these guys for what they do as we share the same visions: giving digital text mode art a meaning in the social era and preventing this nearly forgotten form of digital art from extinction. There is a strong retro interest these days and with the right tool to create text mode art the sky's the limit. You know I'm working on the latter. 

However, one of the files bundled with [Blockalypse](http://blocktronics.org/artpacks/blockalypse/) (may_enz0.tnd) caused AnsiLove/C to crash. Our Tundra implemenation was pretty perfect, so this was quite unexpected. I issued the grand declaration of war and went bug hunting. I found out we have issues for Tundra files with Sauce, [Fred](http://cambus.net) noticed we have problems with the tnd parser getting out of range sometimes and guess what... still no chance to get the file rendered. After two days of trying to resolve the issue I came to a `can't be` conclusion. I finally tried opening the file with Tundra Draw and it failed with a file invalid error. Holy cow. If Tundra can't open it's own file format, it's a seriously broken file. Now Fred as maintainer of [AnsiLove/PHP](http://ansilove.sourceforge.net/) released a patch that makes the file render. Andy's [AnsiLove/JS](http://andyherbert.github.io/ansilove.js/) renders the file out of the box. ANSi art is a legacy that's built upon standards and to maintain said standards I can't add code to AnsiLove/C that makes my app render invalid files. It should report the files is invalid. Nothing more. I know it would have been a great user experience but it's just not the right decision.

I could also write some words about the updated libs, but while this is a minor update for AnsiLove/C, it means a lot to [AnsiLove.framework](http://github.com/ByteProject/AnsiLove-C). But more on that once the new framework is out.
