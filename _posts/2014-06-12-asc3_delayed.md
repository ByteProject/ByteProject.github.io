With Apple's recent announcements (OS X 10.10 Yosemite and the Swift programming language) I felt it's not a good time to release Ascension III now and in it's current state, even though I know how much you guys are desperately waiting for it.

I started developing the successor to Ascension and Escapes about a year ago. I improved it very much, added many new features and also handcrafted a beautiful retro inspired UI. Read my [Movement](http://blog.byteproject.net/articles/Movement_at_45N_180W/) article in case you don't know why I decided to merge both apps. I'm always aiming for the best possible user experience. To make it short, I will rewrite Ascension III and all the underlying frameworks in Swift and I will take care of all those great improvements introduced with Yosemite. Sadly, Ascension III will be Yosemite only. I expect this from many developers. 10.10 Yosemite is the iOS7 for the Mac desktop. Many updated apps were iOS7 only since then. 

I promise you will understand the delay once you see what's around the corner, plus: I have now the opportunity to finalize features that I wanted to add with a later release, for example ANSimation and 24-bit ANSi. Hold on, just a little bit longer and you will fall in love!

### The Problem? 

None. You can use Escapes as long as Ascension III isn't out yet.

As you can see, current Escapes works just great on OS X 10.10 Yosemite. So long, stay brave!
