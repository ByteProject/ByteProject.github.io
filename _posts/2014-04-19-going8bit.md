At some point in your life (most likely when you realize you're getting older) you become nostalgic, walk down memory lane and remember some of the greatest moments from the days when you were young. I'm sure you have your own crucial experience, so do I, but the one night that literally changed everything for me was Christmas Eve 1986, when my parents gave me a Commodore 64. I was nine years old.

  <figcaption>the Commodore 64: highest-selling single computer model of all time</figcaption>
</figure>

The Commodore 64, commonly called "C64", sometimes "CBM 64" (CBM is for Commodore Business Machines) and "VIC-64" is the highest-selling single computer model of all time. It was a home computer for the masses. Affordable, easy to use and with outstanding graphic- and music synthesizer capabilities. Nearly all of my friends had a C64 back then. I willingly remember countless hours of playing games and programming in Basic. Yes, I wrote my first lines of code on a C64. You never forget your first love. I'm sure you agree.

Today, our technology is far beyond of what we were able to imagine back in the 80s. So it's generally no problem to go back in time. You can easily fire up your emulator of choice and there you are. While this might be more than enough for most of the people, I knew it's not enough for me. That's when I decided to become a retro collector. This is surely the hard way, keep in mind we are talking about devices that were built 30 years ago. Even though millions of units were sold, just a few of them are in really good shape and if you finally find one, it will cost you lots of money. These were my goals: a C64 unit (any model), a Commodore monitor, common C64 perpherials, all in good condition. The C64 and monitor should go well together in terms of color color and design. The decision was made and the hunt began.

### Commodore 1702 Video Monitor

Don't expect one of these rare monitors waiting around the corner for you. The 1702 was introduced in 1982 and it offered superb picture quality. It was way ahead of it's time and it's truely a beauty. Collectors are mostly focused on the classic ["bread bin"](http://www.c64-wiki.com/images/9/9d/Commodore64.jpg) design of the C64. The Commodore 64 had that look until 1986 (the early years). Video Monitor Model 1702 fits in color and design to the C64 bread bin, making it bascially the one monitor every collector wants to have. I had no deceitful hopes in finding one. Many people actually connected their C64 to a TV as a much cheaper alternative (with poor picture quality), so the 1702 sold not anywhere near the device it was built for. Model 1702 is also known for not travelling well. If you buy one on the internet, chances are good you recieve it broken. 

Let's summarize. It's desperately wanted, not many units sold, no chance to get one on the internet. Not to mention if you finally find one it's probably in bad shape. The estimated likelihood of getting one for me was... zero? Later models like the 1802 and the Amiga monitor 1084 are much more common and pretty easy to find. I expected getting a 1084, it was absolutely okay for me. Even though initially built for the Amiga, the Commodore 1084 in fact is a great monitor for the Commodore 64, though it won't fit to your bread bin in terms of color and design. But maybe sometimes, if you are lucky enough you can expect the unexpected. This is how I found a 1702 without even looking for it.

I was looking for the C64 first. A bandmate gave me one as a present once, 1983 early model, very bad shape. Well, he told me it runs great but at the time I was not interested in using it. It ended up in a box in my basement. I searched at least two hours for it and came to the conclusion it must have been vanished into a parallel universe. Never mind, wanted to have good looking unit anyway. Said bandmate is Commodore collector by the way (mainly Amiga and C64), he is even capable of repairing broken units. Much of the Commodore wisdom I gained over the last weeks, most notably differences in mainboard assembly, revisions, chips and chipsets comes from him. He was quite patient with me so thank you for your support buddy!

In Germany, eBay runs a Service called "Kleinanzeigen". Users are able to put stuff online for local pickup. It's not like the regular eBay auction you know. You set a price range, you will be contacted by people nearby and they will tell you what they are willing to pay. It's a nice service where you are still able to get some rare stuff for a bargain. 

When searching eBay Kleinanzeigen I found this one: "We have a C64 here, make me an offer". It was just 18 Kilometers away so I thought it's worth a try. I offered 20-60 Euros depending on model and the overall condition of the C64. They had no idea about the model and the condition of the unit, so I've been asked to drive there and have a look at it myself. When I arrived, they brought me to their living room. I saw a Commodore box and thought... oh woot original packing just to realize it is a Commodore 64 printer. Don't get me wrong, the condition was like new, but nobody wants a Commodore printer anymore. The elderly woman then told me they had thrown away the old Commodore keyboard as it was in horrible condition and I surely want something new. I was like... you did what?! I told her that the so-called keyboard actually was the whole C64 and that it's the only thing that made me drive to her. She was visibly shocked, stating her husband is just in this moment carrying the C64 down the stairs. So if it's not the C64, what the hell is it? 

Guess! It was the Commodore 1702 Video Monitor, wrapped in it's original box and in mint condition. They bought it for their son but he never really used it. He had a TV in his room where he connected all of his stuff so it went back into the box and was stored safely in case he needs it later. Later never happened. They also had some peripherals in good condition, like a reset switch, a Commodore PSU belonging to  a [C64C](http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/C64C) (a later 64 model), a [Commodore 1541C floppy](http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/1541) and a tons of 5¼ floppy disks. Kindly as I am, I explained they don't have what I am looking for (and I strained myself so nobody would see my joy of finding a rare 1702 monitor and nearly impossible to find in that condition). I offered to grab their stuff (without the printer) for 40 bucks. Yes, I'm a true philantropist. The price was okay for them but I have been told to take the printer with me as well as they don't need it. No sooner said than done! Seems I clearly made a first good experience as a retro collector.

### Commodore 64

Even though I was lucky with the monitor, it had a bad aftertaste because now I was limited in getting an old bread bin. Finding a 1084 Amiga monitor and a C64C would have been much easier and they just fit perfectly together. I wanted a functional setup with good looking units, but I did not aim for the hardest but best possible solution to achieve. So now matters were complicated further by the fact that most of the old C64 models look horrible after all these years, are probably modified or just not working. Damn. Once more, I searched eBay Kleinanzeigen. Found one around the corner (4 Kilometers), contacted the offerer, but did not get a response. 

After days of searching I found a small ad from someone 80 Kilometers from here, dating back to April 2013. Chances were good he just forgot to delete the offer: "Selling a Commodore 64, like new, local pick up only!". I didn't really expect it to look like new, many people want to make their objects more attractive to possible buyers so they let their rubbish shine in a different light. You know what I mean. Nevertheless, I phoned that guy. He was instantly surprised, because he already forgot about the small ad but fortunately the C64 was still available. We agreed to a price (unseen) for 45 Euros if it's really in said condition. I expected to find out it's not, so I am able to beat down the price to 20 or 30 Euros, which would still be a bargain for a good working unit.

</figure>

I was surprised, shocked, amazed, I don't really know but I ended up staring at a unit that clearly never was in use. Then he explained. He bought the C64 back in 1987, just because everybody had one. He didn't even buy a floppy or datasette for it. So he came home with his shiny new Commodore, connected it to his TV, read in one of the C64 books he bought and played around with it for maybe two hours. He didn't quite understand why the world is so excited about home computers, but he understood it's much more time necessary to get along with it. So he put it back into it's box and stored it in a cupboard in the living room... and he never took it out again. Never. Until now. The whole situation felt so unreal. If I'd say units in this condition are rare I'd definitely make an understatement.

  <figcaption>the ports on the back are a good indication of the condition</figcaption>
</figure>

I had a look at the ports on the back, you always should when hunting down a Commodore 64. You will see signs of use in various degrees, in particular the user port and the cartridge slot. It was very common to distribute ROM based extensions, those could be games, programming language extensions like the very popular [Simons' Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simons'_BASIC) or even whole operating systems like [The Final Cartridge III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cartridge_III). We will cover these two cartridges in `Going 8-bit Part II`, for now just bear in mind I named two of the rather important suspects. Anyway, there were `no` signs of use on the back of this C64 as you can see on the picture above. It looks like it comes straight from the factory. Please note that there is no dust visible, not even when taking a look at the mainboard from one of the ports. It was perfectly stored over the years. Woot! I took it with me for 45 bucks and obviously made a snatch. 

After countless waves of joy I arrived home and the unit gave me food for thought. What the hell do we have here? It's a bread bin (exactly what I was looking for), perfectly preserved but none of the models I knew at the time. Actually I thought I was well-prepared for the hunt by studying models and even mainboard assembly and revisions. The case color resembles much of the original bread bin color, though there might be a tiny bit more gray in here, the color might also be a bit lighter. Allthough it could be quite possible I'm wrong and the color matches exactly the bread bin color of the first Commodore units. This C64 and my 1702 monitor (which we know is mint) look absolutely coherent together, the brown tones are the same range. The common bread bin you usually encounter today is aged, used and scarred by yellowing. What you percieve as it's color is nowhere near the look of 1983 when these units were new. So let's say the Commodore 64 I just acquired has the right color. But there are noticeable differences. 

<figure>
  <img src="/images/postimages/going8bit/6.jpg">
  <figcaption>white keyboard with symbols on the front side of the keys</figcaption>
</figure>

First off, the connector of the PSU (power supply unit) comes with 4 pins, basically later C64 models (not before 1987) are known for this. Incidentally, now that we are talking about the PSU: if you hunt down your Commodore 64 of choice be sure to always check the power supply. Better yet, check it twice. The 64 PSU has a bad record, most of them needed to be replaced after just a few years. Newer PSU were slightly better and improved but still far from being perfect. A borky PSU may cause irreparable damage to your C64. Remember: nothing dies as silently as a microprocessor. 

Another noticable difference is the white keyboard with symbols on the front side of the keys. Commodore used these keyboards for the first C64C version in 1986. When they revised the C64C in 1987 to lower production costs, they did a cheaper version of the keyboard as well, placing the symbols on top. It seems parts of this C64 date back to the early C64C era, which doesn't make sense because Commodore aimed for marketing the C64 as serious personal computer and that's why they did a [redesign](http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/C64C) of the case, moving away from the well-known bread bin look. It was not before summer 1988 when they officially decided to return with a revised low-budget version of the bread bin, called [C64G](http://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php/C64G) (sorry but this page isn't available in English). The type label of the C64G says "C64G", there are slot inscriptions on the back of the case and that said, the case is the same white color as the keyboard. Whatever we have here is clearly no C64G.

Every now and then you see an unusual looking C64 up on eBay. Most times, these are 8-bit variants of Frankenstein's monster. Someone, somewhere back in time modified these units to have that look, either because something was broken (and fixed by using spare parts from a later model) or maybe the goal was just making the unit different and unique. So don't be afraid to discover classic bread bins with white keyboard or C64C's with black keys but don't expect some rare limited edition models. The 64 was produced for the masses. There are some rare models of course, but they are not as obvious as you probably think they are. Well, I couldn't escape the feeling what I just acquired might be one of those rarities. It is sealed and I had no reason to not believe the story the seller told me. Allow me to point out that he was 101% sure he bought it in summer 1987. Let's investigate further.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/postimages/going8bit/5.jpg">
  <figcaption>type label on the bottom reveals a lot about the unit</figcaption>
</figure>

The type label clearly says "Made in USA", but you can also read the german word "funkentstört" which tells us it's a model produced for the german market. This is rather unusual as Commodore had their own factory in West-Germany. What the...? I needed some help to reveal the secret, so I phoned my buddy. His reaction was: "No way, you found one of the rare Aldi models? Holy shit!", and then he told me everything about it. Aldi is a discount super market chain here in Germany. They started selling hardware in 1986, at that time pretty unusual. The first computer Aldi sold was the [C16](http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/C16), which was a commercial flop for Commodore in the USA. Production stopped in 1985. Aldi had the opportunity to buy remainders at a very low price, they bundled it as a nice package with a 1531 Datasette and the C16 was sold out within days that summer of '86. Enormous profit comes with desire for more, so just a few months later Aldi contacted Commodore and introduced them to the idea of selling a special Commodore 64 at their stores. Now before we continue, let's see if it works.

  <figcaption>C64 "Aldi", first time in use since 1987</figcaption>
</figure>

Thank goodness! It runs great. Woot! The joint venture between Aldi and Commodore was a win-win situation. Aldi wanted an effordable 64. Commodore already made first steps of producing a new mainboard assembly with much higher integrated chips, reducing production costs. Then they had lots of remainders from older models, so they willingly agreed producing a special 64 variant for Aldi. The mainboards were built in Hong-Kong, and the units were assembled in the USA. Aldi follows the policy of having their specials only available in strictly limited quantity and for a limited time frame (one week). Even though we don't know exactly how much of these units were produced, we all can imagine what strictly limited quantity means. The Aldi C64 was such a huge success in Germany, it was sold out in just a few hours, making it a rare and desirable collectors item today. 

Let me sort out some popular myths about the Aldi C64 and believe me, several of those myths have been brought into orbit over the years:

1. the Aldi C64 is not rare, it's very common
2. some Aldi C64 units were produced in West Germany, (WG-A serial)
3. the Aldi C64 is completely assembled from old parts
4. due to a production error, the Aldi C64 lacks 9V on the user-port and it's incompatible with many popular extensions
5. the Aldi C64 and the C64G are the same

1) The C64 "Aldi" is due to the strictly limited amount of total units produced very rare. Voices stating it's quite common mostly arise from Germany. It's quite understandable, we have another opinion about the model because Germany was target market (and in fact the only country where it was sold), so naturally we encounter one every now and then though that doesn't make it a common model at all. 

2) Rare means wanted. I understand if your bread bin looks pretty much like an Aldi unit you assume it is one. It's even sealed and it was produced in West Germany, it just has to be one? Well, no. I'm sorry. The reason why they are so rare is the reason why there is so much false knowledge about these units around. The last WG-A units produced in Germany were made out of remainders as well. So it is quite possible you have a C64 that looks like one, but that doesn't make it a real Aldi C64. Your WG-A unit has a different mainboard for sure. Take a look at the type label. All Aldi C64 units have a type label saying "C64", they are all "Made in USA" and the serial always starts with "CA4...". If yours does not, it's not the real deal. 

3) No. They used some old parts for production, like case, keyboard, LED and Commodore logo on the case but it came with a new mainboard. The Aldi C64 was the first C64 to feature a full range of high integrated chips, later revisions of this mainboard were used for the revised C64C.

4) This is the most popular myth around and surprise, surprise... it is completely wrong. The rumor dates back to a report the german 64er magazine did in 1992. The editor assumed it is the case when investigating specs of the mainboard. This imbecility runs like a common thread through the whole internet since then. There are even reports some of the units were repaired because of said production error. You can't be vexed with these people considering the availability of these rare units, who has one on the shelf to test it quickly? Now to clarify this once and for all: the Aldi C64 has 9V on the user port, in fact every Commodore 64 has. The mainboard in an Aldi unit is very reliable by the way, it's just the opposite from "production error".

5) They are not the same. The look similar but there are quite a few differences. Production of the C64G started in 1988 (one year after the Aldi 64). The C64G aimed to be a low-budget 64 in every aspect. It comes with the same mainboard assembly (250469) but a later revision. Most notably the color ram has been integrated into the chipset of the C64G, which is not the case with Aldi units. The C64G has port inscriptions on the back and the case overall is much thinner (compared to an original bread bin or the Aldi C64). The C64G case color is identical to the keyboard color. There are three factors to reveal an C64G immediately: the type label says C64G, the Commodore logo on the case is just a sticker (the Aldi still had the metal logo) and special characters are printed on top of the keys. While the C64G was aimed to be produced with minimum production costs and sold at a killer price, the Aldi C64 is probably the last high quality C64 that Commodore made. Though there is no real "bad" C64, they all have their pros and cons.

So how valuable is my unit? That's very hard to tell. It's a rarity and in an even more rare condition. I don't think there are many of these models in similar condition around. Naming a price is quite impossible. It's worth what a collector is willing to pay for it. I don't care anyway. I'm not going to sell it nor am I hiding it away in sterile boxes. I'm glad I found it and I already found a nice place in my office for it. 

### Sneak preview

Thank you for your attention! Initially, I planned to do just one blog post about my 8-bit (collector) experiences, but I'm sure you agree, this article became quite long and there is much more to say. So stay tuned for `Going 8-bit Part II`, where we will cover peripherals, cartridges, supplies and where we unite a 30 year old beauty with achievements of modern technology.
