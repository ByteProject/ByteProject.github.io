A new AnsiLove/C version `2.1.2` is available at the [official repository](http://github.com/ByteProject/AnsiLove-C) on GitHub.

##Changelog

* modified the Tundra parser to not go beyond 24-bits 

##About the update

Not much to say about that one. Tundra stores it's color values in 24-bits padded to 32-bits. So basically the parser shouldn't go beyond 24-bits for getting the color values. There might be demons around. This udpate makes the invalid Tundra file in the latest Blocktronics release to render correctly. Thanks to [Andy Herbert](https://twitter.com/andy_herbert) for contributing the code. Keep in mind: even though it renders now with AnsiLove/C, it's still invalid. Tundra Draw is not able to open the file. We provided Blocktronics with a fixed version of the artwork, you can expect a repack soon.
