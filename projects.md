Since the very beginning, my world is full of bits and bytes. I ended up with what you find here. Welcome to my world.

### Mac App Store
Currently, I ship two apps considered as bestsellers on the Mac App Store.

* [Ascension](http://ascension.byteproject.net) - NFO/DIZ/ASC viewer for OS X
* [Escapes](http://escapes.byteproject.net) - ANSI/NFO/DIZ/ASC editor for OS X

You might want to check them out. If you're already one of my customers, let me thank you so much for your support!

### Future
Right now I'm busy in the final stages of development for what will be `Ascension III`. The roman numeral remarks a change for good reason. This is a complete rewrite with countless improvements under the hood and so many new features (some you wouldn't even expect). It also comes with a completely redesigned and retro inspired UI. Note that  Ascension III will be the first paid Ascension upgrade since four years.  

Even more changes are coming to `Escapes`. Version 2 is in pre-Alpha stage right now. It won't have much in common with the current version. The brandnew Escapes will be a contemporary ANSi art editor / paint, with all aspects you know from modern pixel image editors. 

On top of that, there are two additional projects in the works. I consider them as super secret and there is not much to say about it yet. One app is for Mac and one app for iOS. I will keep you updated.

### Open Source
Here are some projects I found important enough to share with the world.

<div class="github-widget" data-repo="ByteProject/AnsiLove-C"></div>
<div class="github-widget" data-repo="ByteProject/AutoHyperlinks.framework"></div>
<div class="github-widget" data-repo="ByteProject/SVRetroTextView"></div>
<div class="github-widget" data-repo="ByteProject/Ascension"></div>
<div class="github-widget" data-repo="ByteProject/Tau-Ceti-theme"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery.githubRepoWidget.js"></script>

I also contributed code to some important projects like [INAppStoreWindow](https://github.com/indragiek/INAppStoreWindow) and [NSKit](https://github.com/nscoding/NSKit). Visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ByteProject) to find out more.

### Tools of the trade
My weapon of choice for Cocoa/Objective-C development is [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/). I'm using [Textmate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) as general purpose syntax editor and [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) for web development. When I'm not using AppCode's integrated VCS support (which is just great), I'm down with [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Git management. Finally, as command line enthusiast I run [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) and the super awesome [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/).
