I'm driven by passion and commitment, which basically is the essence for creating enjoyable, contemporary, top-selling apps. My first successful product arose from the desire to use it for myself. I'm an avid contributor to the open source scene. Share your code whenever you can.

### Independent software development
In 2012, after years of open-sourcing code for different Apple operating systems, I decided to go indie. Since then, I'm running an independent software development studio responsible for some great and well-known applications. You might want to check out the projects page to find out more. Currently, I reside in a small town called Wittlich, which is located in the beautiful [Eifel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eifel) region in Germany. 

### The sordid details
I'm a retro geek. I love classic computers and consoles, in fact I even collect them. My first computer was a C64 which my parents bought me back in 1986. Metal is my music, varying from classic 80s-style Heavy Metal to Swedish Death Metal. I'm lead guitarist for the band [Bloodwh√∂re](http://bloodwhore.net).
