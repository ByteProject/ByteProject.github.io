Head over to [http://byteproject.net](http://byteproject.net) to see it in action. This is basically a modified version of [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's extended with some useful plugins, customized [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighting and and various theme tweaks. Feel free to fork. This stuff is released under the `MIT License`.
